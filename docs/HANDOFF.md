# Handover

**Date:** 5 November 2026.
**Describes:** `main` at `a796b80`, and the branch `permission-labels`
started from it.

This is for continuing the work on a new PC: for the project owner, and for
a fresh Claude Code session that remembers nothing of the sessions before
it. The rules for working in this repository are in
[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) and are not repeated here: read it first, all of
it. The product is described in the [documentation home](README.md).

A handover is a snapshot. Anything here can go out of date; when it
disagrees with `git log`, GitHub or CLAUDE.md, they win.

## 1. Where things stand

**`main`** is at `a796b80` ("Update Symfony to 8.1.11 for eight security
advisories"). CI passed on it: run 41949795261, all three jobs (Pest on
PostgreSQL 18 and Redis; Pint, Larastan and composer audit; Scramble).

**What was finished last:** `encrypt-queued-messages`, merged into `main` by
fast-forward:

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `842adec` | `scripts/run-suite.ps1` picks a safe number of parallel workers (`-Processes`) |
| `0394a84` | Every queued notification is encrypted in the queue and in `failed_jobs`; an architecture test requires it |
| `8a6b235` | CLAUDE.md: gateways on demand, billing gateway per merchant, permission labels |
| `8f99aa9` | A test proves the exchange-rate app ID never leaks from a failed refresh |
| `0aab2cc` | [Deployment](deployment.md): encrypted jobs and changing `APP_KEY` |
| `a796b80` | Symfony 8.1.11, for eight security advisories |

Before that: `scrub-error-reports` (`b7172ee` to `53515da`), which keeps
database errors' personal data out of reports, logs, the console, Sentry and
failed jobs.

**Branches:**

| Branch | State |
|---|---|
| `permission-labels` | **In progress:** item 2a below. Not merged |
| `encrypt-queued-messages`, `scrub-error-reports`, `handover-scripts` | Merged; kept on GitHub |
| `step-10-customers` to `step-18-returns`, `step-10b-social-sign-in`, `step-15b-invoices`, `step-16b-paystack` | Merged; kept on GitHub |
| `docs-schema-comments`, `fix-token-links`, `fix-payment-holds` | Merged; kept on GitHub |
| `ci-proof-docs`, `ci-proof-pint`, `ci-proof-stan` | Gone, as intended. They existed only on the old laptop (each broke one CI check on purpose, to prove CI catches it) and were never meant to be kept |
| Dependabot: `laravel/telescope` 5.26.0, `spatie/laravel-activitylog` 5.1.3, `spatie/laravel-medialibrary` 11.23.10, `spatie/laravel-permission` 8.3.2, `spatie/laravel-translatable` 6.15.0 | Open, not merged. Each needs its CI run checked and the owner's approval |
| Dependabot: `shivammathur/setup-php` 2.40.0 | Merged |

## 2. What comes next, in order

Each item is its own branch, starts only when the owner says so, and ends
with a stop for review (CLAUDE.md section 17).

### a. Permission labels (`permission-labels`)

From the CLAUDE.md section 10 rule. Every permission has a translated label
and description and a group, in all 20 languages, and says whether it is
sensitive. Both permission lists return them, sorted by group and label and
searchable. Every staff and platform route answers in the dashboard's
language (`Accept-Language`), while store content stays in the store's
language. The branch also makes `scripts/wait-for-ci.ps1` survive a sleep
and wait for the CI workflow only.

### b. Step 18b: exchanges and the refund-destination extension point

From CLAUDE.md sections 17 and 18. An exchange is the return plus a linked
replacement order made by a staff action that reuses checkout's pricing,
stock and tax steps; the price difference is settled by a payment or a
refund. Where a refund goes becomes an extension point: the original
payment is core's default and only destination, and modules add others
through a core contract. Returns today is described in
[Returns](tenant/returns.md).

### c. Steps 19, 20 and 21

Storefront, then Messaging (email first, see [Messaging](tenant/messaging.md)),
then Data tools, as CLAUDE.md section 17 lists them.

### d. The frontend, after core

The frontends come after the core API is done. The frontend repository is
`Haeyzed/sellora-frontend`.

## 3. Open follow-ups

| Follow-up | Where it is recorded |
|---|---|
| **Audit ignore** GHSA-9vw2-f4vp-x7gf / PKSA-qhjm-rpqc-qkn6 is still in place. It is the same entry as the PHPUnit one below | [composer.json](../composer.json), `config.audit.ignore` |
| **PHPUnit ignore:** remove it once Pest allows PHPUnit 13.4.4 or later, then run `composer update` for PHPUnit and `composer ci` | The same entry's note in [composer.json](../composer.json) |
| **Step 20 alerts with no listener:** `OrderRefundedBeyondPaid`, `OrderPaidAfterCancellation`, `OrderPaymentsKeepFailing`, `PaymentHoldKeepsFailing`, `CommittedPaymentRefundFailed`, `PaymentDisputed`, `PaymentNeedsReview`, `PaymentOverpaid`, `PaymentUnresolved`, `PaymentGatewayNeedsReconnecting`, `RefundStillPending`, `RefundSucceededAfterFailing`, `CashCollectionOverdue`, `DeliveryFailed`, `StockRunningLow`, `VariantSoldOut` (16), plus `RefundNeedsReview` and `RefundFailed`, which have a listener but don't reach staff: 18 in all. Until Step 20, staff see none of them | Only here and in earlier review reports |
| **Return messages for Step 20:** `ReturnRequested`, `ReturnApproved`, `ReturnRejected`, `ReturnReceived`, `ReturnInspected`, `ReturnRefundStarted`, `ReturnCompleted`, `ReturnCancelled` | [Returns](tenant/returns.md) |
| **Real mixed-refund tests** (part of a refund went back, part failed, across payments) once `Wallet` or `GiftCards` exists; today only a fake gateway produces the mixed case | [Returns](tenant/returns.md), the "Never twice" table |
| **Split-paid refunds:** which part of a split-paid order goes back first is decided when the first payment module is built | CLAUDE.md section 18, the refund-destination rule |
| **Driver app, for the frontend:** a delivery is handed over in three calls: pick up, on the way, then delivered (multipart, with proof and the recipient's name, and an `Idempotency-Key`). The API also allows delivered straight after pick-up, but the buyer can follow a delivery only while it is on the way, so the app should not skip that call | [Delivery](tenant/delivery.md); the note itself only here |
| **Legal checks** before `Wallet`, `AccountCredit` or `Installments` launch (stored value, credit and instalment rules differ by country) | [Roadmap](roadmap.md), each module's section |
| **Reverb broadcasting** is not installed: it needs a stable release that allows `guzzlehttp/psr7` 3 | CLAUDE.md section 17, Phase C |
| **Open decisions** (themes, Horizon, search engine, platform domain, billing for merchants outside Africa) | CLAUDE.md section 16 |
| **Invoice check false alarms:** it can flag a refund whose credit note is still on its way; the grace period narrows this but doesn't remove it | Only here and in earlier review reports |
| **A credit note edited outside the app** can leave tax behind that the final credit can't take back; the daily invoice check reports it | Only here and in earlier review reports |
| **Other errors that can quote personal data:** errors are scrubbed only when they are, or were caused by, a database error. Others pass with their message, for example a mail error quoting the recipient's address, which also lands in `failed_jobs.exception` (encryption covers the job's data, not its error). Each needs its own handling in `ErrorScrubber`, one kind of error at a time | Only here (found in `scrub-error-reports`) |
| **Telescope stores exception messages** in full, including a database error's SQL and values. It runs only locally (never in production or staging with real data), so it was left out of `scrub-error-reports` | Only here |
| **Plain-text queued emails** written before `encrypt-queued-messages` is deployed stay readable in `failed_jobs` until the 30-day purge; they are not re-encrypted | [Deployment](deployment.md) |
| **A saved preferred language for staff and platform admins** (a column on each), for Step 20: today a dashboard's language comes only from `Accept-Language`, so emails and alerts sent outside a request (by a job or the scheduler) have no language to use | Only here (decided in `permission-labels`) |
| **Native review of the permission labels and group names** before real merchants use them: Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo and Swahili above all, and ideally every non-English language. They were written without a native speaker; the descriptions were too | `lang/*/permissions.php` and `lang/*/permission_groups.php` |
| **The pre-commit hook** was tried by hand only on Windows (PowerShell and Git Bash); CI now runs the hook check (`composer ci:hook`) on Linux on every push | [CI workflow](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) |

## 4. New PC setup (Windows PowerShell)

The steps, with the machine facts behind them, are in the documentation
home: [local setup on Windows](README.md#local-setup-on-windows). In short,
and in this order:

1. Git, and an SSH key added to GitHub (the remote is
   `git@github.com:Haeyzed/sellora-api.git`).
2. Laravel Herd with PHP 8.4, which brings Composer. Check the PHP
   extensions.
3. PostgreSQL 18, on the port it runs on (default 5432) in `DB_PORT`.
4. Redis.
5. Clone, copy in the old `.env` (section 5), `composer install`.
6. Create `sellora_central` and `sellora_central_testing`, run the central
   migrations, sync permissions and seed.
7. The test template database is built by the tests themselves; nothing to
   do.
8. Install the pre-commit hook.
9. Turn off VS Code's auto-save and format-on-save for this folder.
10. Run `composer ci` as the final check that the PC matches CI.

**Never run `composer setup` with a copied `.env`:** it runs
`php artisan key:generate`, which replaces `APP_KEY`.

## 5. Not in the repository: carry these by hand

Names only. Values are never written in the repository or in a chat.

| What | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| `.env` | Every local setting. **Keep its `APP_KEY`:** encrypted data (store gateway credentials, two-factor secrets, database server passwords) can only be read with the key that wrote it. Never run `php artisan key:generate` on a copied `.env` |
| In `.env`: `DB_PASSWORD`, `MAIL_USERNAME`, `MAIL_PASSWORD`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`, `SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN`, `OPEN_EXCHANGE_RATES_APP_ID`, the `AWS_` keys and the store export bucket settings | Secrets and service settings |
| In `.env`, not in `.env.example`: `PAYSTACK_MANUAL_TEST_SECRET_KEY` | The Paystack **test** secret key for the manual Paystack check. It goes in the local `.env` only |
| In `.env`, not in `.env.example`: `PLATFORM_REGIONS`, `PLATFORM_ADMIN_PASSWORD_RESET_URL`, the three `STORE_EXPORT_*_BUCKET_REGION` settings, `TRANSLATION_DEFAULT_DRIVER`, `TRANSLATION_SOURCE_LANGUAGE`, `OLLAMA_MODEL`, `OLLAMA_API_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `DEEPL_API_KEY` | Local-only settings; copy them with the file |
| The PostgreSQL `postgres` password | Needed to create the databases; it goes in `DB_PASSWORD` |
| The SSH key for GitHub | Make a new one on the new PC and add it to GitHub, rather than copying the old one |
| Local databases (`sellora_central` and any `sellora_tenant_` store databases) | Only if the local test data matters. Otherwise start empty: migrate and seed, then register stores again |
| `.vscode/` settings | Git-ignored; set them again (section 4) |
| Claude Code's own notes about this machine | Moved into the documentation home's setup steps; nothing else is needed |

## 6. How to resume

Paste this as the first prompt in a fresh Claude Code session opened in the
new clone:

```text
This is the sellora-api repository, continued on a new PC. You have no memory of earlier sessions.
1. Read CLAUDE.md in full, then docs/HANDOFF.md and docs/README.md.
2. Run: git fetch --all --prune, git status, git log --oneline -5, and git branch -a. Compare with HANDOFF.md section 1 and tell me anything that differs.
3. Check the environment with the steps in HANDOFF.md section 7. Don't change any file.
4. Report what you found in a few lines and stop. Don't start the next item until I say which one.
Work exactly to CLAUDE.md. Use scripts/probe.ps1 for probes, scripts/run-suite.ps1 for the Landlord suite before a push, and scripts/wait-for-ci.ps1 after a push.
```

The owner's working agreements are in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) section 15.

## 7. How to check nothing was lost

**The clone matches GitHub:**

```powershell
git fetch --all --prune
git status                      # "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
git rev-parse main origin/main  # the same hash twice
git log --oneline -1 origin/main
git branch -r                   # every branch in section 1 that is kept on GitHub
git log --branches --not --remotes --oneline  # nothing: every local commit is on GitHub
```

**The PC matches CI:**

```powershell
php -v                 # PHP 8.4
php -m                 # includes the extensions in the setup steps
composer ci            # Pint, the hook check, Larastan, audit, Scramble, Pest: all pass
.\scripts\db-status.ps1
```

`composer ci` passing is the proof the PC is ready. A run that fails only on
database timeouts proves nothing (for example after the PC slept): run it
again on its own.
